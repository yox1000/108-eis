# Project Ideas â€” System Architecture & End-to-End

---

### 1. Scalable Microservices with CQRS and Event Sourcing

**Build:** Order management system using CQRS + Event Sourcing.  
**Components:**  
- Command service (writes commands/events)  
- Query service (reads event store projections)  
- Event store (Kafka, EventStoreDB)  
- Snapshotting + eventual consistency  

**Tech:** Java/Spring Boot or .NET Core, Kafka/EventStoreDB, PostgreSQL, gRPC  
**Challenges:** Eventual consistency, idempotent commands, event replay, snapshot optimization

### 2. High Throughput Distributed Log Aggregation System

**Build:** Ingest logs from thousands of sources, normalize, index, and serve low-latency search queries.  
**Components:**  
- Log ingestion agents (with backpressure)  
- Distributed messaging (Kafka)  
- Stream processing (Flink/Spark Streaming)  
- Distributed search engine (Elasticsearch/Opensearch)  
- API layer for querying  

**Tech:** Kafka, Flink, Elasticsearch, Go or Java backend  
**Challenges:** Backpressure management, fault tolerance, schema evolution

---

### 3. Custom Distributed Cache with Consistency Guarantees

**Build:** Distributed cache supporting strong/eventual consistency with replication, partitioning, eviction.  
**Components:**  
- Partitioning (consistent hashing)  
- Replication (quorum reads/writes)  
- Eviction policies (LRU, TTL)  
- Failure detection & recovery  

**Tech:** Golang/Rust, Raft or Paxos consensus, gRPC  
**Challenges:** Implement consensus, handle partitions, benchmark latency/throughput

---

### 4. Zero Downtime Deployment Pipeline with Canary Releases

**Build:** Automated CI/CD pipeline with infrastructure as code supporting canary deployments & auto rollback.  
**Components:**  
- GitOps pipeline  
- Infra as code (Terraform/CloudFormation)  
- Deployment automation (ArgoCD/Spinnaker)  
- Metrics & health analysis (Prometheus + scripts)  

**Tech:** Kubernetes, Terraform, Helm, Prometheus, Python/Bash  
**Challenges:** Automate rollout/rollback, measure canary success, integrate monitoring

---

### 5. Distributed Rate Limiter with Token Bucket Algorithm

**Build:** Distributed rate limiter for global API throttling with near real-time enforcement.  
**Components:**  
- Centralized/decentralized token bucket  
- High availability replication  
- Low latency enforcement (Redis, in-memory)  
- Multi-policy support (user, IP, endpoint)  

**Tech:** Redis (Lua scripts), Go/Rust backend, Kubernetes  
**Challenges:** Atomic token consumption, data consistency, scaling

---

### 6. Real-Time Recommendation Engine

**Build:** Online recommender that updates profiles & suggests items in real time from streaming events.  
**Components:**  
- Event ingestion (Kafka)  
- Real-time feature extraction (Flink/Spark)  
- Online ML model serving (TensorFlow Serving/custom)  
- REST/gRPC API  

**Tech:** Kafka, Flink, TensorFlow, Python/Go backend  
**Challenges:** Low latency, model versioning, real-time feature updates

---

### 7. Fully Distributed Tracing System

**Build:** Distributed tracing & visualization system for microservices (mini Jaeger/Zipkin).  
**Components:**  
- Trace context propagation libs (HTTP headers, gRPC metadata)  
- High throughput trace collector  
- Storage backend (Cassandra/Elasticsearch)  
- Visualization frontend  

**Tech:** OpenTelemetry, Kafka, Cassandra, React  
**Challenges:** Context propagation, sampling, storage scaling
